# MonoBlog

This is one of my early projects from when I started learning web development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap).
The layout is very simple: just a few pages, a navbar, and some card-style posts.

I recently cleaned up the UI a bit to make it more readable while keeping the original idea the same.

### Live Demo

### What I used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Bootstrap (CDN)

### Why this repo exists
I like keeping some of my old beginner work to see how much I’ve improved over time.

Nothing fancy here, just early practice.
